# Data-Science-Tutorials
These are the Data Science Tutorial with proper comments so that anyone can understand them easily.You don't need to remember all the functions and methods but you should know what they do and where and how to apply them.You can check the arguments of any function by shift+TAB key when the cursor is in the brackets of the function. I will be uploading Python and Machine Learning Tutorials very soon.Data Science is a very interesting field to work upon.I hope these tutorials will be helpful to you.For any doubt or query , you can mail me at sckanina@gmail.com.
